Python library for creating games in terminal

## Installation

You can't install pyterm with pip, because I haven't finished the project yet.

1. First you go to your project path with `cd`.

2. Next you clone project with git:
    ```shell
    git clone "https://github.com/PyTermProject/PyTermProject.git"
    ```
3. Move `pyterm` folder to your project, and now you can use it by importing the `pyterm` library

## Requirements

Your terminal emulator must be support true color feature in order to display image colors in a right way.
In addition, you must use a monospaced font that includes the lower half block unicode character: `▀ (U+2580)` and `▄ (U+2584)`.
